<b>*Game Objectives*</b>
<br>

  * This is an RPG game based of Star Wars. Here is how the app works:

  * When the game starts, the player will choose a character by clicking on the fighter's picture. The player will fight as that character for the rest of the game.

  * The player must then defeat all of the remaining fighters. Enemies will be moved to a different area of the screen.

  * The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture.

  * The player will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent.

  * The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters. The player loses the game the game if their character's `HP` falls to zero or below.

<b>*Additional Information (Slightly Less Relavent)*</b>
<br>

  * The background images occasionally flicker between transitions, and I am not quite sure why. I will need to look into a way to potentially make a smoother transition in the future.

  * The first background image is not supposed to start where it does, but the zooming effect works for this particular project.

  * Some browsers play the background music automatically, but others do not. There may be a webkit framework or something similar that needs to be added to the css
