Have background music play throughout - DONE
Have background image cycle between different images - DONE

1) Fix issue where main character doesn't take damage - looks like it has to do with "renderMessage"

3) Get loading screen to work - it currently loops in a small div infinitely - not sure why

4) Get hovering functionality to work
